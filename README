This tool is based on genscan, which uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
to do gene prediction in DNA sequences.

The problem with genscan is that it does not consider insertions and
deletions in the sequence, because it assumes that the sequence is of
good quality.  This quality factor is not met by ESTs, thus we tried
to create a tool that uses the same HMM and weight matrix as genscan,
but does consider possible insertions and deletions.  The result is
ESTScan.  For more info, read the ISMB'99 paper...

Version 2.0 of ESTScan takes a step back from genscan's model and
tables. Not only coding but also untranslated regions are modelled
using high order HMMs and transitions between the translated and
non-coding regions are modelled with start and stop profiles. In the
subdirectory MkTables the necessary tools to generated profiles and
n-mer usage tables are provided.

This is a Perl module.  It requires my BTLib module, which should be
located in the parent directory of this one.
They can be built and installed like any other Perl modules:
  cd <BTLib directory>
  perl Makefile.PL
  make install


ESTScan.pm contains the Perl part of the code that reads in the
matrices file.  The C code that does the actual computation is located
in estscan.c.

The file ESTScan contains the Perl executable that implements the user
interface.

Launched with no arguments, ESTScan will display a usage message, and
print the default values of all the switches.

We have installed a mailing list for discussion about CDS prediction
in general. It will be used for announcements and discussion about
the ESTScan program, and related topics, including:

 - installation
 - algorithms
 - models
 - creation of weight matrices

The hope is that people using ESTScan, or other CDS prediction programs,
will be able to share knowledge and help each other.

We make no promises whatsoever to answer all the questions that will be asked
here.  But we will do our best, time permitting, to help.

In order to subscribe the list, send an e-mail message containing the word
'subscribe' in its subject and body to estscan-request@mail.isrec.isb-sib.ch
